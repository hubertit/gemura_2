# Gemura 2.0 - Project Organization Rules

## Project Structure

- `/backend` - NestJS backend code
- `/mobile` - Flutter mobile app
- `/docs` - All documentation (organized by category)
- `/scripts` - Utility scripts (organized by purpose)
- `/database` - Database files

## Documentation Standards

- All docs in `/docs` organized by category
- Each directory has a README.md
- Use clear headings and structure
- Include code examples where helpful
- Update docs when code changes

## Script Organization

- Deployment scripts → `/scripts/deployment`
- Testing scripts → `/scripts/testing`
- Migration scripts → `/scripts/migration`
- Utilities → `/scripts/utils`

## File Naming

- README.md for directory indexes
- *_GUIDE.md for how-to guides
- *_STATUS.md for status reports
- *_RESULTS.md for test results

## Code Organization

- Backend: Feature-based modules in `backend/src/modules/`
- Mobile: Feature-based modules in `mobile/lib/features/`
- Shared code in appropriate common/shared directories

## Task Completion

- On completion of each task (especially when touching mobile code), run `flutter analyze` from the `mobile/` directory and fix any new **errors** or **warnings** introduced. Inform the user of the analyze result.
